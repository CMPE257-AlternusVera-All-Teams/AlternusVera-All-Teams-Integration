68% error rate in Michigan Voting Machines. Should be, by law, a tiny percentage of one percent.	In a Dec. 15 tweet, Trump claimed there was a "68% error rate in Michigan Voting Machines. Should be, by law, a tiny percentage of one percent." He suggested Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson would face legal scrutiny for the alleged errors. "Did Michigan Secretary of State break the law? Stay tuned!" Trump wrote. Trump was reacting to a consultant’s report that a judge made public Monday in connection with an election lawsuit in Antrim County, in northern Michigan, where a misapplied software update initially led to incorrect unofficial results being reported on election night. But Trump’s tweet misinterprets the findings of the report, which itself presents a misleading picture. Michigan vote tabulators do not read ballots incorrectly 68% of the time. Nor is that statement true if applied only to the Antrim County tabulators in the Nov. 3 election. And the report Trump reacted to, while ambiguous and inaccurate on the subject of errors, does not make that claim.The report is signed by cybersecurity analyst Russell James Ramsland Jr. of Allied Security Operations Group, a firm whose representatives have provided analyses and affidavits for lawsuits brought by Trump allies, falsely alleging voter fraud and election irregularities.	republican	Donald Trump	tweet	0	0	0	0	1	0
The percentage of Americans with natural immunity from getting COVID-19 is “a very powerful vaccine in itself.”	During a Dec. 8 press conference about Operation Warp Speed, President Donald Trump likened the spread of coronavirus throughout the population — which experts agree bestows some immunity on the people who became ill — to having a COVID-19 vaccine. "You develop immunity over a period of time, and I hear we’re close to 15%. I’m hearing that, and that is terrific. That’s a very powerful vaccine in itself," said Trump, who was responding to a reporter’s question about what his message to the American people was as the holidays approach and levels of COVID cases in the U.S. continue to rise. It wasn’t the first time Trump had given credence to the idea that if enough people in a population gain immunity to a disease by being exposed to it, the illness won’t be able to spread through the remainder of the population — a concept known as "herd immunity."	republican	Donald Trump	press conference	0	0	0	0	1	0
Wisconsin is one of the few states that doesn’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day.	It took all day and then some for Milwaukee election officials to count their mountain of absentee ballots in the 2020 presidential election And those 170,000 votes proved decisive. When the ballots were added to the state total about 3:30 a.m. Nov. 4, Wisconsin swung from a lead for President Donald Trump to a lead for former Vice President Joe Biden. A later canvass and recount confirmed Biden won the state by about 21,000 votes. But the swing and timing sparked an avalanche of misinformation, with Trump and an array of other Republicans claiming there was something nefarious about the late arrival of Milwaukee’s votes. Of course that’s ridiculous: We’ve noted in multiple False and Pants on Fire ratings that the absentee votes from Milwaukee, a Democratic stronghold, were long expected to heavily favor Biden and to come in late. The controversy stems from limitations in state law on when election workers can process absentee votes — limitations that were unchanged despite the massive increase in this kind of voting amid the pandemic. State Sen. Tim Carpenter, D-Milwaukee, raised this point in a letter to the state’s Republican legislative leaders, seeking a bipartisan task force to improve Wisconsin’s voting system.	democrat	Tim Carpenter	press conference	1	0	0	0	0	0
Jon Ossoff is “a socialist.”	In one of the two Georgia runoffs that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate, GOP incumbent David Perdue used the S word — socialism — to brand his opponent, Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue’s attack came in an interview on a TV show hosted by Mike Huckabee, the Republican former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate.  "Philosophically, where do you and (Ossoff) differ significantly? What’s the main difference between you?" Huckabee asked. "Well, it’s very simple," Perdue replied. "He’s a socialist."  Perdue has used the term repeatedly about Ossoff, although more often he refers to what he claims is the documentary filmmaker’s support of a socialist agenda. President Donald Trump labeled Joe Biden a socialist — a claim we rated False, but one that some believe helped Trump win Florida in the Nov. 3 election. Much of the evidence Perdue cites about Ossoff’s policy positions is inaccurate. And even if what he cited were correct, it doesn’t amount to Ossoff being a socialist. 	republican	David Perdue	press conference	0	0	0	1	0	0
Says that this year is the first time during his 27 years as senator “that two African Americans have ever served on the same (Senate) committee.”	The monuments and paintings of Confederate leaders that adorn the Texas Capitol became a subject of debate last year as Senate Republicans approved a bill that would have made it harder to remove or relocate historic monuments, including those memorializing Confederate figures. Those discussions resumed last month during a hearing of a Senate committee empaneled by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick charged with reviewing the history of the Confederate portraits in the Senate chamber. That committee, the Senate Chamber Review Committee, is composed of five Republicans and three Democrats, including the only two Black members of the Senate — Sens. Royce West, D-Dallas, and Borris Miles, D-Houston. As the hearing got underway, West took a moment to recognize what he believed was a milestone. "I just want to make sure that I make a note that this is the first time in history, during my tenure as senator for the past 27 years, that two African Americans have ever served on the same committee," West said. "I personally want to thank the lieutenant governor for making that happen, even though it is dealing with the issue of Confederate monuments." "I’m sure glad you noted that," responded Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, who chairs the committee. "Everything we do here is a part of history, and when something like that happens, we need to drive a stake in the ground and note it." Black members first served in the Texas Senate during Reconstruction, when recently freed slaves won the right to vote and run for political office. During this era, three Black senators were elected to the Texas Senate between 1869 and 1882 — George Ruby, Matt Gaines and Walter Burton, according to the Texas State Library and Archives Commission.	democrat	Royce West	hearing	0	0	0	0	1	0
17 House GOP members send letter to Pelosi urging Swalwell's removal from Intel Committee	A group of 17 Republican House members sent a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi Tuesday urging her to “immediately remove” Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell from the House Intelligence Committee. It comes in response to reports over his past ties to a spy from China, who posed as a college student, networked with up-and-coming American officials and allegedly slept with a pair of Midwestern mayors. “Because of Rep. Swalwell's position on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, his close interactions with Chinese intelligence services, however unintentional they may be, are an unacceptable national security risk,” the letter reads. Noting that the committee “handles some of the most sensitive information our government possesses—information critical to our national defense," the letter continued, "we urge you to immediately remove Rep. Swalwell from his position on the House Intelligence Committee.”	neutral	fox news	news	0	0	1	0	0	0
Joe Biden butchers Jon Ossoff's name at Georgia rally	"Honk for your next United States Senator Jon Orsoff!" Biden said in Atlanta while stumping for Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in his first campaign event since clinching the presidential election in November-- including the state of Georgia, which has historically been red. Although Biden's frequent gaffes have been a laughing matter for his opponents, the president-elect's trip comes the day after members of the Electoral College met in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, formalizing the former vice president’s 306-232 electoral vote victory over President Trump. Biden narrowly carried Georgia in the presidential election, making him the first Democrat to win the state in the White House race in more than a quarter-century. Biden's presence in the state further emphasizes the need for a Democratic win if his presidency is to put forth meaningful legislation to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and tackle other issues during his administration. Democrats would need to secure both of Georgia's Senate seats during the runoffs, which would then lead to a 50-50 tie of lawmakers in the upper chamber. The tie-breaking vote would then fall to incoming Vice President Kamala Harris. It would mean the Democrats would control both houses of Congress as well as the White House, which Republicans desperately want to avoid. 	neutral	fox news 	news	0	0	0	0	0	1
Biden to name Gina McCarthy to top domestic climate job	President-elect Joe Biden will name Gina McCarthy as his White House climate czar, a source familiar with the decision tells CNN, making the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency his top domestic climate coordinator. McCarthy, who currently serves as the head of the Natural Resources Defense Council, will lead Biden's newly formed Office of Domestic Climate Policy, a source said. McCarthy served as the administrator of the EPA from 2013 to 2017 under President Barack Obama. The source added that Ali Zaidi, currently New York's deputy secretary of energy and environment, will serve as White House deputy climate coordinator. Zaidi served in different climate-focused roles in the Office of Management and Budget and on the White House Domestic Policy Council during the Obama administration. The move is the latest example of Biden's prioritization of the climate crisis. McCarthy joins former Secretary of State John Kerry, who the President-elect named his special presidential envoy for climate, as top Biden officials tasked with addressing the issue. Kerry will be a Cabinet-level official in Biden's administration and will sit on the National Security Council. Kerry is expected to focus on the foreign policy and international aspects of the climate crisis, while McCarthy will focus on domestic issues. It is also another symbolic rebuke of President Donald Trump and his policies. Months after being sworn in, Trump announced the US would leave the Paris Climate Agreement and then revoked a key regulation that underpinned America's pledge in the landmark 2015 international agreement. That regulation -- the Clean Power Plan -- was written by McCarthy when she served as EPA administrator, along with others in the Obama administration. It established the first-ever federal regulations to limit carbon dioxide from power plants.	neutral	cnn	news	0	1	0	0	0	0
Trump Organization must turn over documents to NY attorney general, judge rules	A state judge ruled Tuesday that the Trump Organization must turn over documents related to a property whose tax abatements were being investigated by New York Attorney General Letitia James' office. The Trump Organization previously claimed the documents were protected by attorney-client privilege. Amy Carlin, an attorney for the Trump Organization, argued Tuesday that the Trump organization had "every expectation that those communications would be confidential," regarding discussions about a property in Westchester County involving an engineer. The attorney general's office argued that the documents were not privileged, in part, because the Trump Organization had "waived privilege" when it disclosed certain documents to the IRS to "gain benefit," said attorney Eric Haren with the attorney general's office. New York AG seeks to depose Eric Trump in investigation of Trump&#39;s finances New York AG seeks to depose Eric Trump in investigation of Trump's finances Haren said that "literally everything other than the final appraisal value" was not disclosed to his office. James' office has been investigating President Donald Trump and the Trump Organization since 2019, when Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen testified before Congress that Trump's annual financial statements inflated the values of his assets in order to secure favorable loans and insurance coverage, but deflated the value of other assets in order to reduce real estate taxes.	neutral	cnn	news	0	1	0	0	0	0
